/**
 * React components for the WorkBuddy dashboard: the sidebar footer card and the
 * centre-column panel it opens.
 *
 * Both render one {@link PanelView} projected by `./panel.ts` — no fact is
 * derived here. Strings are resolved through the injected `t` seat, bound to the
 * `panel.workbuddy` namespace by each registration, so the surfaces follow the
 * harness's active language (a language switch mints a fresh `t`, which is the
 * invalidation the renderer propagates).
 *
 * The footer card is the panel's home: the sidebar shell renders it in the foot
 * area directly ABOVE the Settings seat, so both pools' account counts and
 * credit totals are on screen without opening anything. Clicking it selects the
 * `workbuddy-panel` cell this file also renders — and unlike a
 * `sidebar.panellist` row, whose button chrome the SHELL owns, this entry owns
 * its whole surface and therefore calls `open()` itself.
 *
 * Styles ride the two stylesheets `./ui-styles.ts` returns (the panel's own, and
 * the settings page's shared row pieces), injected once by the client entry.
