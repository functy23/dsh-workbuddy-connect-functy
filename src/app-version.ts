/**
 * The international desktop app's version, used as the `/v3/config` UA.
 *
 * The App-shaped catalog is served only to a User-Agent carrying the product
 * name. Measured on 2026-09-11: the *space* form `WorkBuddy AI/<v>` is
 * rejected (HTTP 400, code 12403), while the terse `WorkBuddyAI/<v>` form —
 * with or without the space removed — returns the 21-model App document. The
 * UA is therefore built from the form measured against the live gateway, not
 * from the earlier prose that recommended the space form.
 *
 * The version feeds two request fields and nothing else: the UAs above, and
 * the chat identity's `X-IDE-Version`. A missing App, an unreadable plist, or
 * a bad cached value degrades to the last saved value and finally to a
 * compiled-in constant, and never blocks credential use or the provider.
