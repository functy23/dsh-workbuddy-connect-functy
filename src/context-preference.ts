/**
 * Per-model context-window preference: which of the upstream-declared lengths
 * the user wants this model to run at.
 *
 * Why this is a real setting and not a display toggle: the window is what pi-ai
 * uses to clamp a request's output budget
 * (`available = contextWindow - promptTokens - safety`), so the chosen value
 * changes what actually gets sent. Choosing 1M instead of 200K is the difference
 * between a long transcript continuing and being cut off.
 *
 * Storage is one small JSON document per variant, keyed by model id. A model the
 * upstream stops declaring a length for keeps its entry — the preference is the
 * user's, and a catalog that comes back with the length again should find the
 * choice still made. The value is only *applied* when the upstream still offers
 * it, so a stale entry can never widen a window the model does not have.
 *
