/**
 * WorkBuddy models for DeepSeek Harness, reusing the WorkBuddy desktop apps'
 * sign-in. Registers one provider per product variant — `workbuddy` for the CN
 * app and `workbuddy-ai` for the international one — while streaming, tool
 * calls, compaction, and permissions stay Harness-owned.
 *
 * The two variants are assembled by the same factory and differ only in their
 * {@link WorkBuddyVariant} descriptor: each gets its own credential store,
 * catalog, upstream client, shim, adapter, probe state, and routes. Neither
 * variant's startup, catalog fetch, or credential state can stop the other from
 * registering — a user with only one app installed sees only that group.

  // Settings, on the one generation this build targets.
  //
  // DSH 0.1.7 replaced the provider-service section API (`installSection`,
  // `update`, `get`) with schema-derived profile Config forms: a plugin's
  // composition entry IS its settings namespace, its `Config` schema is the
  // form, and a write through `settings.update`/`mutate` commits into the
  // marked `volatile` fields IN PLACE — no fiber remount — then dispatches
  // `loader/volatile-update` to the owning fiber.
  //
  // Two consequences shape this block:
  //
  // 1. **No section install.** The fields are already served: the plugin row in
  //    `cordis.patch.yml` carries this plugin's `Config`, so `describe()`
  //    projects it and the native configuration editor writes it. What the host
  //    still needs is the `auto: false` policy, which declares that this plugin
  //    ships its own pages and the host must not synthesize a second one.
  //    The per-variant split \u2014 two namespaces (`workbuddy` / `workbuddy-ai`),
  //    each owning only its own fields \u2014 existed to keep one card's form from
  //    editing the other's path; on 0.1.7 there is one entry, so both cards read
  //    the same document and the split is gone.
  // 2. **Facts frozen at assembly must be re-applied on a write.** The catalog's
  //    maximum-window flag and each credential store's desktop path are decided
  //    once, when the runtime is built, so they are re-derived from `current()`
  //    on every volatile update \u2014 which is what makes a saved preference reach

   * - **none → some, identity changed**: additionally drop the previous

   * - **same identity**: nothing to do — the pool refreshes tokens on demand,
   *   and re-fetching on every rotation would hit the catalog endpoint for no
