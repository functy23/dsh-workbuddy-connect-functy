/**
 * Per-account request accounting: how much this plugin has sent through each
 * account, and how much of the prompt the upstream served from its cache.
 *
 * Why the plugin counts at all: WorkBuddy's billing endpoint answers "how much
 * quota is left" but publishes nothing about requests or tokens — the numbers a
 * reader wants when asking "what is this account actually costing me". They only
 * exist in the chat stream, which this plugin is the path for, so it counts what
 * it relays.
 *
 * What is measured, and what is NOT claimed:
 *
 * - requests / prompt tokens / completion tokens / cache-read tokens are read
 *   from the upstream's own usage block when it sends one, per request;
 * - the cache-hit rate is `cacheRead / (cacheRead + uncached prompt)`, which is
 *   the definition the upstream's numbers support. It is reported as ABSENT —
 *   never as zero — while no response has carried a cache field, because "we do
 *   not know" and "nothing was cached" are different answers and a zero would
 *   read as the second;
 * - the counters are a plain tally since {@link WorkBuddyUsageCounters.sinceMs},
 *   not a billing-cycle figure: the cycle's reset instant is a string the
 *   billing endpoint words for a human, and inventing a parse for it would put a
 *   wrong window behind a right-looking number.
 *
 * Cost of the accounting: one JSON file per variant, written at most once every
 * {@link WorkBuddyUsageStore.flushIntervalMs} (default 5s) — a per-request write
 * would turn a chat turn into disk I/O. A failed write is logged, never thrown:
 * the counters are a report about the user's traffic, not traffic itself.
 *
