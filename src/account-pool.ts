/**
 * The per-variant WorkBuddy account pool: every credential this plugin may
 * send upstream, the order it tries them in, and how long a failed one is
 * benched.
 *
 * Why a pool at all: the upstream rate-limits and quota-limits *per account*
 * (429 / 402), and the plugin used to have exactly one credential — the
 * desktop app's. A single 429 was therefore the user's problem. With several
 * accounts the plugin can treat one account's limit as a routing decision
 * rather than a failure.
 *
 * Two credential sources feed the same pool, and both are *long-lived*:
 *
 * - the desktop app's sign-in, captured automatically whenever it is present
 *   (startup and every credential sweep). Signing out of the desktop app does
 *   NOT remove it: the captured tokens keep working until they expire, and the
 *   refresh token usually keeps them working well past that. That is the whole
 *   point — the desktop app is one account among several, not the plugin's
 *   master switch.
 * - a QR sign-in started from the plugin's own card, which lands a brand-new
 *   account without a desktop app at all.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to the network: this module is pure pool state (with
 * atomic file persistence), so it can be reasoned about and tested without a
 * credential. {@link module:dsh-workbuddy-connect/account-service} owns the
 * network half.
 *
 * @module dsh-workbuddy-connect/account-pool
