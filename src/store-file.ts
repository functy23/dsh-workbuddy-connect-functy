/**
 * The on-disk shape every plugin-owned store shares: a version-tagged JSON
 * document in the plugin's own data directory, written atomically and read as "nothing saved"
 * whenever anything about it is wrong.
 *
 * Six stores implement that same policy — the account pool, the saved catalog,
 * the usage tallies, the visibility lists, the probe results and the context
 * preferences. Each one used to carry its own copy of the read guard and its
 * own copy of the temp-file dance, which meant a change to either policy (a
 * size cap, a permissions bit, a new failure class) had to be made six times
 * and could be missed in five.
 *
 * The write is deliberately synchronous: every store's public write method is
 * synchronous and called from timers and event handlers, so an async writer
 * would push an `await` through six classes and their callers for no gain at
 * this size. What it is *not* is naive — see {@link writeStoreDocument}.

/**
 * Replace a store document in one atomic step.
 *
 * Three details make this safe rather than merely tidy:
 *
 * - **A per-write temp name.** Two processes writing the same store at the same
 *   moment must not share a `${path}.tmp`: the second `writeFileSync` would
 *   then truncate the first writer's half-written file, and whichever rename
 *   landed last would publish it. The suffix is random and the open is
 *   exclusive (`wx`), so a colliding name fails loudly instead of silently.
 * - **The mode is on the fresh inode**, not applied afterwards, so the document
 *   is never briefly readable by others.
 * - **The temp is a sibling**, so the rename stays on one filesystem and is
 *   therefore atomic — a reader sees either the old document or the new one.
 *
 * A caller that must not lose a concurrent writer's change has to serialize the
 * whole read-modify-write, not just this write; see the class docs of the
 * stores that say so.
 *
 * @param path - absolute path of the store.
 * @param document - the complete next document.
