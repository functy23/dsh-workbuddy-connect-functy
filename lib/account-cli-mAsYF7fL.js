*   It is generic enough to be readable here only because the baseline step has

	* from the desktop App's selector: the console document lags the product
	* one, and the product roster itself churns day to day (`auto`,

	*
	* What distinguishes the two variants here is the User-Agent, not the path:
	* the gateway splits `/v3/config` by client identity, and the split is
	* load-bearing. A CLI-shaped UA yields the CLI's roster — the chat models
	* this plugin serves — while an App-shaped UA yields the App's internal
	* roster. CN keeps the CLI UA it sends for chat, so the catalog it
	* advertises is exactly the one its own requests can use. The international
	* variant has no CLI identity, so it keeps the App-shaped UA.
	*
	* Membership is the `cli` roster intersected with the usable rows (see
	* {@link parseModelCatalog}); the promo badges the product document does
	* not carry are merged in from a best-effort console read — see
	* {@link fetchPromoBadges}.
	*
	* Responses are unwrapped and classified the same way — `readEnvelope` plus
	* `envelopeError` — so an expired session or exhausted credit is reported as
	* such rather than as a generic catalog failure.

*
* Why a pool at all: the upstream rate-limits and quota-limits *per account*
* (429 / 402), and the plugin used to have exactly one credential — the
* desktop app's. A single 429 was therefore the user's problem. With several
* accounts the plugin can treat one account's limit as a routing decision
* rather than a failure.
*
* Two credential sources feed the same pool, and both are *long-lived*:
*
* - the desktop app's sign-in, captured automatically whenever it is present
*   (startup and every credential sweep). Signing out of the desktop app does
*   NOT remove it: the captured tokens keep working until they expire, and the
*   refresh token usually keeps them working well past that. That is the whole
*   point — the desktop app is one account among several, not the plugin's
*   master switch.
* - a QR sign-in started from the plugin's own card, which lands a brand-new
*   account without a desktop app at all.

*
* 1. `POST /v2/plugin/auth/state?platform=CLI` → `{state, authUrl}`

* 3. `GET  /v2/plugin/login/account?state=…` (bearer = the fresh access token)

*
* The endpoints live on the same host as that region's chat traffic, so a CN

* minted. Nothing is persisted until a sign-in completes.
