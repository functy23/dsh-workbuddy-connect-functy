---

This is a fork of [corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect](https://github.com/corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect), not the upstream project. The upstream npm package is still `dsh-workbuddy-connect` (currently `0.7.1`, DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` only). This repository publishes as **`dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy`**, with a different UI and account model.

Both the CN **WorkBuddy** app and the international **WorkBuddy AI** app are supported: whichever you have installed shows up as its own model group; both installed shows both, each with its own account and credit.

## How this fork differs

Compared with upstream **0.7.1** (2026-10-01). Features both trees share are not listed as ours.

| | Upstream `dsh-workbuddy-connect` 0.7.1 | This tree 0.13.11 |
|---|---|---|
| UI | two legacy plugin cards in Settings | sidebar credit card + centre dashboard + settings section page |
| Accounts | follows the desktop app's current sign-in | multi-account pool: rotation, QR, token, desktop adopt; a removed account is not swept back in |
| Credit | on the settings card only | in the sidebar, remaining or used/total, can be hidden |
| DSH | **`0.2.0-rc.2` only** | `0.1.7-alpha.1` / `0.2.0-rc.1` / `0.2.0-rc.2` |
| Update notice | bottom-right reminder | not ported |
| npm | `dsh-workbuddy-connect` | `dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy` |

Both trees have: CN/AI groups, image input, reasoning-effort detection, per-account model visibility, CN enterprise credit, picker rate/promo badges, Windows Electron discovery, per-region effort-rejection codes.

## Screenshots

WorkBuddy models in chat (rate and reasoning level in the composer, usage and credit on the status bar):

Picker groups WorkBuddy / WorkBuddy AI, with rates and free badges:

Settings page for the account pool, cycle credit and the model list:

Choose which models appear in the picker:

## Features

- **Zero configuration**: after install, pick a WorkBuddy model in chat. The plugin reuses the desktop app's sign-in and follows account switches.
- **Dashboard**: a credit card at the sidebar foot opens the centre-column panel; Settings → **WorkBuddy** manages accounts, models, context length and reasoning-level detection. The card itself can be switched off.
- **Multi-account rotation**: several accounts per product. Requests rotate across available ones; a rate-limited account is benched and retried later. Add via QR, a pasted token, or the desktop app's own sign-in.
- **Credit**: sidebar can show remaining credit or used/total; CN enterprise accounts use the enterprise billing endpoint.
- **Images**: most models accept paste or drag-and-drop.
- **Reasoning levels**: declared sets show up directly. Undeclared models can be probed from the picker on Web / Desktop (a few requests, may spend credit).
- **Visibility**: saved per signed-in account. Hiding a model only affects the picker; existing chats keep working.

## Install

Prerequisite: the WorkBuddy desktop app is installed and signed in (same for WorkBuddy AI). A mismatched DSH core fails to start.

**This release (`0.13.11`)** targets DSH `0.1.7-alpha.1`, `0.2.0-rc.1` and `0.2.0-rc.2`. Newer prereleases (e.g. `0.2.1-rc.x`) are not covered automatically.

> **Do not install npm's `dsh-workbuddy-connect`.** That is the upstream package, a different code line.

### From the UI

DSH **Add plugin** accepts a package name (optional version), a Git address, a tarball, or an absolute local path.

1. Open **Settings → Plugins** (some clients label this Extensions).
2. Choose **Add plugin**.
3. Paste either identifier and confirm:

```text
dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy
```

or:

```text
github:functy23/dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy
```

4. **Reload the page**; if nothing changed, **restart the DSH client**. The desktop app starts its own profile — do not use `dsh --profile desktop` as a launcher.

### From the CLI

Replace `<profile>` with the profile you use (`web` / `desktop`).

From npm (recommended):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy
```

From GitHub (the repo ships prebuilt `lib/`; git installs do not run `prepack`):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add github:functy23/dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy
```

```sh
# Web
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy
dsh web
```

```sh
# Desktop (DSH 0.2+ lets the CLI manage the desktop profile)
dsh plugin --profile desktop add dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy
```

Before DSH 0.2 the CLI refused the `desktop` profile — use the UI path above. A wrapped desktop app (e.g. DSH NEXT) exposes CLI through its bundled `desktop-cli`, which needs `pnpm` on PATH.

Where things live:

```text
Settings → Models                            ← no WorkBuddy rows (intentional)
Settings → Built-in Plugins → workbuddy-connect  ← read-only runtime status
sidebar foot                                 ← credit card → centre dashboard
Settings → WorkBuddy                         ← accounts, models, sidebar
chat model picker                            ← WorkBuddy / WorkBuddy AI groups
```

## CLI

The executable is still `dsh-workbuddy-connect` (same as the provider ids, so existing scripts keep working):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> exec dsh-workbuddy-connect status
dsh plugin --profile <profile> exec dsh-workbuddy-connect accounts
dsh plugin --profile <profile> exec dsh-workbuddy-connect doctor
```

CN by default; add `--provider workbuddy-ai` for the international product. `accounts` is read-only. `logout` removes only the plugin-owned copy.

## Where the data lives

Scoped per profile, all under `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<profile>/.dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy/` (by default `~/.dsh/profiles/web/.dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy/`), in two layers:

```text
.dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy/
├── config/                            # your decisions — deleting these loses state
│   ├── .workbuddy-auth.json           # CN credential (the plugin's own copy)
│   ├── .workbuddy-ai-auth.json        # international credential
│   ├── .workbuddy-accounts.json       # CN account pool
│   ├── .workbuddy-ai-accounts.json    # international account pool
│   ├── .workbuddy-context.json        # chosen context length per model
│   └── .workbuddy-model-visibility.json
└── state/                             # rebuildable — safe to delete
    ├── .workbuddy-catalog.json        # this account's last good model list
    ├── .workbuddy-probe.json          # reasoning-level probe results
    ├── .workbuddy-usage.json          # request tallies
    ├── .workbuddy-app-version.json
    └── .workbuddy-host-heartbeat.json # what `status` reads to see if the host is up
```

**How the profile is determined**: DSH does not expose the active profile name to a plugin, so the plugin looks under `$DSH_HOME/profiles/` for the profile that **declares it** (reading each profile's `package.json`); when more than one does, it disambiguates by whether that profile's installed copy resolves to this same code. `web` and `desktop` therefore stay independent. When none can be determined (running from a source checkout, say) it falls back to `$DSH_HOME/.dsh-workbuddy-connect-functy/`; the `DSH_WORKBUDDY_DATA_DIR` environment variable overrides the whole directory.

> **Upgrading from 0.13.x**: the old versions kept these files loose in the root of `$DSH_HOME` (`.workbuddy-*.json`). This change does **not** migrate them, so after upgrading the account pool and caches start empty: accounts must be added again. The old loose files can be deleted.

## Known limitations

- Verified on macOS Web / Desktop (DSH `0.1.7-alpha.1` / `0.2.0-rc.1` / `0.2.0-rc.2`, Node 22+). Windows probes Local then Roaming AppData; WSL reads the mounted Windows profile first. If user names differ, set `WORKBUDDY_AUTH_FILE` / `WORKBUDDY_AI_AUTH_FILE`.
- Sidebar display preferences need a host that can write settings; missing fields mean no switch is drawn.
- The international catalog comes from the app's own interface and can break; the plugin then degrades to the last successful catalog, then the built-in roster.
- International enterprise billing is unverified; a product with no credential no longer shows a model group.
- Relies on WorkBuddy client interfaces; app updates may require plugin updates.
